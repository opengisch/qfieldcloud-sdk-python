More detailed documentation can be found [here](https://docs.qfield.org/reference/qfieldcloud/sdk/)

## Module usage

```python
from  import sdk

client = sdk.Client(url="https://app.qfield.cloud/api/v1/")
client.login(
    username="user1",
    password="pass1",
)

projects = client.list_projects()
> projects
Projects:
0       myusername/myproject1
1       myusername/myproject2
...
```

## Development

Contributions are more than welcome!

### Code style

Code style done with [precommit](https://pre-commit.com/).

```
pip install pre-commit
# if you want to have git commits trigger pre-commit, install pre-commit hook:
pre-commit install
# else run manually before (re)staging your files:
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Cloning the project

One time action to clone and setup:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/opengisch/qfieldcloud-sdk-python
cd qfieldcloud-sdk-python
# install dev dependencies
python3 -m pip install pipenv
pre-commit install
# install package in a virtual environment
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```
To run CLI interface for development purposes execute:

```shell
pipenv shell # if your pipenv virtual environment is not active yet
python -m qfieldcloud_sdk
```
To ease development, you can set a `.env` file. Therefore you can use directly the `qfieldcloud-cli` executable:
```
cp .env.example .env
pipenv run qfieldcloud-cli
```

### Building the package

```shell
# make sure your shell is sourced to no virtual environment
deactivate
# build
python3 -m build
# now either activate your shell with
pipenv shell
# and install with
python -m pip install . --force-reinstall
# or manually ensure it's pipenv and not your global pip doing the installation
pipenv run pip install . --force-reinstall
```
Voil√†!
